# Hey, I'm Rusty

- I am 18 years old and I am looking to improve my skills in programming.
- I am currently attending Lake Superior State University to improve my skills in Computer Science.
- I lost access to my other [account](https://www.github.com/rustytrim), guess it's time to restart on making a bunch of projects again.
- I know how to use C++, C#, TypeScript, Java, Rust (Sort of), and Python (Sort of)
